# Project Goals and Achievements

Track Book Distribution Expenses:

We developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) view to manage book categories, such as Business Analytics, Python, Data Science, and Math. This feature allowed users to categorize books effectively and keep track of expenses associated with each category.

# Increase Data Security and Availability:

By utilizing Django's built-in authentication and user management system, we ensured that only authorized personnel could access and modify book data. The data was securely stored in a SQLite database, which provided both security and availability.

# Customize and Automate Business Processes:

We developed another CRUD view to add detailed book information, including title, author, publishing date, category, and distribution expenses. This automation reduced manual entry and errors, streamlining the business process.

We also enabled data import from existing spreadsheets into the web application, allowing seamless transition and integration of old data into the new system.
Develop a Report View:

Finally, we implemented a report view that allowed the team to view and analyze distribution expenses according to book categories. This provided clear insights into where resources were being allocated and helped in making informed business decisions.

# Conclusion

By developing these features, we successfully met the project objectives, providing Rumi Press with a robust system to manage book categories, track expenses, and maintain data security and availability. The customized and automated processes enhanced efficiency and provided valuable insights into their distribution expenses.
